# Scheme
As a project within my Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs class in Spring 2022, I created an interpreter that reads Scheme expressions, evaluates them, and displays the results. For instance, the interpreter would return these values after writing the expression in after `scm>`.

``` ruby
scm> 2
2
scm> (+ 2 3)
5
scm> ((lambda (x) (* x x)) 5)
25
```
